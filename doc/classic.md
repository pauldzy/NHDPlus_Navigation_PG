## Classic Navigation Logic

#### General

#### Upstream with Tributaries

#### Upstream Mainline

#### Downstream with Divergences

* Execute a full downstream mainline navigation from the start flowline
* Load temporary table with all flowlines in VPU having a hydro sequence value less than or equal to the start flowline.
* Mark flowlines having the same levelpathid and terminalpathid as the start flowline.
